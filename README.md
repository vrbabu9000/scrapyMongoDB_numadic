# Scrapy News Extraction Project
- This is an initial task given by Numadic, a Fintech Company where I had applied for an Internship.
- This project is a quick work to meet the rules stated as per the application.

## About the project:
- I have used the scrapy package to scrap news articles from India Today website.
- The scraped data was backed up into the MongoDB Atlas and connected with the streamlit application.
- This was a rush work and I couldnt pay much attention to the UI.
- It works just fine. However, it is slow since I couldnt play around much with the inbuilt cache functions.
- Many tweeks could be done to speed up the process.
